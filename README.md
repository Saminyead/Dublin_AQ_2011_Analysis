The dataset contains the data of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and particulat matters (PM 2.5 and 10). The aim of the project is to gain insights from this large dataset, and try and identify patterns in the data. 
Python, in particular - the Pandas library, is being used to analyze the data. Later, other libraries will also be used for visualization purposes.
